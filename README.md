Many people develop a certain type of disorder in their life-time which can be attributed to 
behavioral risk factors that act as a precursor to having insomnia, sleep apnea, etc. This 
novel analysis is to view the group combinations of behavior risk to score the potential 
high risk that lead to a certain sleep disorder. The data gathered for insights in this 
approach involves data from the Center for Disease Control which contains answers to 
individual survey questions that is related to behavior and lifestyle components. The data 
has 374 observations with 11 variables that includes gender, age, occupation, sleep 
duration, sleep quality, physical activity level, stress level, BMI, heart rate, daily steps, and 
sleep disorder. From these variables, interaction columns are created to measure the value 
of risk between two variable on how it affects the response.
